#Yeelight Bedside Lamp RE Notes

## General

**Local Name:**           = XMCTD_

## Endpoints

**Service UUID:**         = 8e2f0cbd1a664b53ace6b494e25f87bd
**Notify UUID:**          = 8f65073d9f574aaaafea397d19d5bbeb
**Characteristic UUID:**  = aa7d3f342d4f41e0807f52fbf8cf7443

##Notify types:
When receiving a notification, the first 2 hexes (4 chars) define what is being received

### Device Pairing Status

- `4363..` Device Status
    -  `1` Unauthorized/Not paired
    -  `2` Authorized/Paired
    -  `4` Already authorized device (UUID)
    -  `6` Device not ready to pair (maybe it is off)
    -  `7` Lamp disconnect imminent

##Command Formatting

Commands are sent via the `noble-device` - `writeDataCharacteristic` command. This takes a buffer. We convert the command
into hex, so all of the data is sent as `Buffer(string, 'hex')`

##Pairing with the Device

###Pair

Device should be on, to pair with the device, use `discoverAndPair` providing a client id, this can be any valid hex,
see `test.js` for an example. This returns an event emitter to give you a handle when pairing events have happened.

When the lamp begins to flash, press the Scene Button on your Lamp to pair.

###Unpair

Currently, I do not know if the lamp has a code for unpairing, if this is found please let me know. To unpair, you can
change the client id, and this will cause a repair the next time the `discoverAndPair` api is used.

##Brightness and Color
setColorAndBrightness(red,green,blue,brightness,callback)
red, green and blue are integers between 0-255. Brightness between 0-100.

##Temperature and Hue
Temperature can range from `1700` to `6500`, and Hue from 0 to 100.

##APIs Described

### discoverAndPair

Registers for notify, to subscribe to the lamps events.

Sends the `4367` command with a client uuid to the characteristic.

The lamp then responds with `43631` to signal that it is in pairing mode.

Once paired, the Lamp will notify with `43632` to confirm successful pairing.

The user provided callback is then provided the Yeelight lamp peripheral.

Future attempts to pair with an already paired lamp will result in instant connection, adn the lamp returning 43634.

#### events

discoverAndPair returns an event emitter to give you a handle when pairing events have happened. See test.js as an example.

These are the following events:

- **connected** when connected to the device (via extension from the noble-device library)
- **notify** when notified by yeelamp via the notify uuid, returns the hexstring
- **paired** when pairing is successful, returns the hexstring
- **pairing** when pairing is in progress and the scene button needs to be pressed on the device, returns the hexstring
- **pairing-failed** when pairing has failed, returns the hexstring

### turnOn and turnOff
The On/Off state is switched with the `4340..` command. `434001` will turn it on, `434002` will turn it off.

### setColorAndBrightness
The color and brightness is changed with a hex string sent to the `4341` command.
The first hex is the amount of red, then green blue and brightness.

Red, for example is sent as: `4341FF000000000000000000000000000000`.

### setTemperatureAndBrightness
The temperature and brightness is changed with a hex string sent to the `4343` command. The next 4 are a hex code for
the temperature, and the following 2 are hex for the brightness. An example for warm (6500) and bright (100) is
`434319646400000000000000000000000000`.
